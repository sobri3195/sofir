feat: Add restore default CPTs feature to recover missing menus

## Problem
Users reported that CPT menus (listing, profile, article, event, appointment) 
disappeared from WordPress admin sidebar after they were accidentally deleted 
through the SOFIR admin interface.

## Solution
Implemented a "Restore Default CPTs" feature that allows users to recover 
all 5 default custom post types and their taxonomies with a single click.

## Changes

### CptManager (includes/sofir-cpt-manager.php)
- Added `restore_default_post_types()` method
- Added `restore_default_taxonomies()` method
- Both methods restore seed data from `get_seed_post_types()` and `get_seed_taxonomies()`
- Fire action hooks for extensibility

### ContentPanel (includes/class-admin-content-panel.php)
- Added `handle_restore_default_cpts()` handler
- Added "🔄 Restore Default CPTs" button in UI
- Added confirmation dialog before restoration
- Added informative description and success message
- Registered admin_post action hook

## Features
- ✅ One-click restoration of 5 default CPTs
- ✅ Restores all associated taxonomies
- ✅ Non-destructive (doesn't delete existing CPTs)
- ✅ Auto-flush rewrite rules after restoration
- ✅ Confirmation dialog for safety
- ✅ Nonce verification for security
- ✅ Capability check (manage_options only)
- ✅ Event hooks for developers

## Restored CPTs
1. listing - Business/location directory with 8 fields
2. profile - User profiles with 4 fields
3. article - Blog/news content with attributes
4. event - Event management with date, capacity, location
5. appointment - Appointment booking with datetime, provider, client

## Restored Taxonomies
- listing_category, listing_location
- profile_category
- event_category, event_tag
- appointment_service

## Documentation
- CPT_MENUS_RESTORE_FIX.md - Technical documentation
- PANDUAN_RESTORE_CPT_MENU.md - User guide in Indonesian

## Testing
✅ Syntax validation passed
✅ Non-destructive restoration verified
✅ Rewrite rules flush properly
✅ UI elements render correctly
✅ Security checks in place

## Backward Compatibility
✅ No breaking changes
✅ Existing CPTs preserved
✅ Custom CPTs unaffected
